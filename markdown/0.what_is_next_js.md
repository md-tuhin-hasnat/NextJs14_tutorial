## What is Next Js?

It is a framework for building server-rendered react application

## Why learn Next Js?

1. **Routing:** Routing refers to the process of determining which component or page should be displayed based on the URL or user's navigation. In Next.js, you can define routes using the built-in routing system, allowing you to create dynamic and nested routes easily.

2. **API routes:** Next.js provides a feature called API routes, which allows you to create serverless API endpoints within your Next.js application. You can define these routes in a separate file and handle incoming requests, making it convenient to build backend functionality directly within your frontend codebase.

3. **Rendering:** Next.js supports both server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). SSR renders the pages on the server and sends the fully rendered HTML to the client, while SSG generates static HTML files during the build process. This flexibility allows you to choose the rendering method that best suits your application's needs.

4. **Data Fetching:** Next.js provides various methods for fetching data, such as using the getStaticProps and getServerSideProps functions. These functions allow you to fetch data from APIs or databases and pass it as props to your components during the rendering process. This ensures that the data is available when the page is rendered on the server or statically generated.

5. **Styling:** Next.js allows you to style your components using various approaches. You can use CSS modules, CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components or emotion, or even global CSS stylesheets. Next.js provides built-in support for these styling methods, making it easy to style your components in a modular and maintainable way.

6. **Optimization:** Next.js includes several optimization techniques out of the box. It automatically optimizes your application by code splitting, lazy loading, and prefetching resources. It also provides features like image optimization, automatic static optimization, and caching, which help improve the performance and loading speed of your application.

7. **Dev and Prod build system:** Next.js provides a powerful build system that optimizes your application for development and production environments. During development, Next.js offers features like hot module replacement (HMR) and fast refresh, which allow you to see the changes you make in real-time without losing the application state. In the production build, Next.js optimizes and bundles your code for better performance and deploys it as a highly optimized static or server-rendered application.
